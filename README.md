# RespiraSense---Asthma-Monitoring-Device
RespiraSense - Asthma Monitoring Device Description
The primary aim of this project, titled RespiraSense – Asthma 
Monitoring Device, is to develop an intelligent system capable 
of predicting early signs of asthma deterioration and potential 
asthma attacks using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The 
system leverages historical and real-time lung function data to 
identify patterns and trends that may indicate an increased risk 
of an asthma episode. The project focuses on implementing and 
deploying lightweight ML algorithms specifically using 
classifications features that will implement Linear Regression 
and Decision Trees to analyze variations in a patient’s 
respiratory performance. By learning from the user’s historical 
lung function data, the model detects downward trends in lung 
performance, abnormal variations relative to the individual’s 
baseline, and sudden changes that could signify an elevated 
asthma risk. The ML workflow involves data acquisition, 
preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, followed by 
deployment on an embedded microcontroller platform. 
Depending on the model complexity, deployment is achieved 
using TinyML on an ESP32 microcontroller or via cloud-based 
services such as Firebase. Alternatively, TensorFlow Lite for 
Microcontrollers is utilized for efficient on-device inference. 
The system outputs a daily asthma risk score, which quantifies 
the user’s likelihood of experiencing an asthma episode. When 
the predicted risk exceeds a predefined threshold, the device 
issues an alert or notification, enabling the user to take 
preventive measures in advance. Ultimately, the RespiraSense 
project aims to contribute to proactive asthma management by 
providing a cost-effective, low-power, and portable monitoring 
solution that supports early detection and intervention through 
embedded Machine Learning.
